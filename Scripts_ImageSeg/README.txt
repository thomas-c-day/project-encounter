This folder contains subdirectories of scripts used to segment and analyze microscopy images of microbial groups with fluorescent beads attached.

There is one example image also uploaded here. The example image is split across 3 folders:
TD - this is the DIC channel for the image.
GFP - this is the green fluorescent channel
Probs - this folder contains an image with the segmentation confidence output from Ilastik.

These three images are combined to count the number of particles per aggregate.

The main calling script is "Segmentation_and_counting..."
Use this script to play around with segmentation parameters.

Full datasets are uploaded to XYZ website.
