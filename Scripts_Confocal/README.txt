We used confocal z-stacks to count the number of cells per microbial group, and correlate this to apparent group volume. We used the slope of this relationship to estimate the per-capita resources acquired by microbial groups.

The script used to generate 3D segmentations of confocal data is called Cell_Seg_3D.m.
the script used to load and analyze the outputs of the segmentation script is called segmentation_results_analysis.m

For both scripts, if you'd like to run them yourself, you will need to download the necessary image/segmentation files from (___) and correct the filepath within the script.
